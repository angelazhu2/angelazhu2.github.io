collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/inatator.md
excerpt: 'Expert-in-the-loop platform to collect species data and improve species distribution model accuracy in collaboration with computer vision faculty and researchers and iNaturalist engineers. Developed and deployed (Docker) a web application that enables experts to annotate species range maps using predictions from the SINR GeoModel- ML-based range prediction model to refine species distributions. This was done by designing an interactive mapping interface (React JS, Python) and database to store predictions and annotations

Project was apart of the Data Science for the Common Good Program at UMass Amherst in collaboration with UMass Researchers (Prof. Grant Van Horn and Prof. Subhransu Maji), University of Edinburgh researchers (Prof Oisin Mac Aodha, Christian Lange), eBird engineer (Sam Heinrich) and iNaturalist engineer (Alex Shepard).'
