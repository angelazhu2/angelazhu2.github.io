I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University in the [MLQUeST Lab](https://hutchinson-lab.github.io/), advised by Prof [Rebecca A. Hutchinson](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rah/). I'm interested in applying machine learning to biodiversity and wildlife conservation, more specifically in species distribution models and using computer vision to identify species.

Before my PhD, I obtained my Master's degree from UMass Amherst where I got to work with Prof [Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/index.html) and Prof [Grant Van Horn](https://gvh.codes/) on building species distribution models using citizen science data. Prior to that I worked in industry as a software engineer at Microsoft. 

Research Interests: Computational Sustainability and Public Interest Technology.

Hobbies: Biking, Running, Spotting Wildlife, and Listening to Podcasts.
