I am a Master's student in the CICS program at University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am currently applying to PhD programs in CS hoping to apply machine learning to biodiversity and wildlife conservation, more specifically using computer vision to identify species and species distribution models.

Research areas I am interested in are computational sustainability and public interest technology.
