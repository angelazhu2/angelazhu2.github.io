I am currently applying to PhD programs in CS hoping to apply machine learning to biodiversity and wildlife conservation, more specifically using computer vision to identify species and species distribution models.

Previously, I received my BS from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Afterwards I worked in industry as a backend software engineer at Microsoft for 5 years before starting my Master's program at UMass Amherst. At UIUC, I gained an appreciation for the midwest and built a foundation in computer science. Then at Microsoft I developed my technical skills in developing systems. Now at my graduate program I am exploring research at the intersection of computer science and ecology, though a research project on species distribution models extending the work from [SINR GeoModel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02564) paper.

Research Interests: Computational Sustainability and Public Interest Technology.

Hobbies: Biking, Running, Spotting Wildlife, and Listening to Podcasts.
